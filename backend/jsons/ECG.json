        "Follow-up": "Your resting electrocardiogram (ECG) shows some abnormalities, but your subsequent stress ECG (Treadmill) is negative for myocardial ischemia and underlying coronary heart disease. It is likely that the abnormalities are not clinically significant. Please note that the stress ECG test has 70\\\\% sensitivity when employed as a screening tool for coronary heart disease, 30\\\\% of cases have false positive or false negative outcomes. This is inherent in this test. It is recommended that you consult our doctor for further evaluation if you have exertional chest pain, breathlessness, palpitations or fatigue."

        "Follow-up": "Your resting electrocardiogram (ECG) shows some abnormalities, but your subsequent stress ECG (Treadmill) does not suggest underlying coronary heart disease. However, your blood pressure was noted to be high (exercise hypertension) during the test. Some studies have shown that exercise hypertension may predict future arterial hypertension in individuals with normal resting blood pressure. It is recommended that you have your blood pressure checked every 6 monthly. A low sodium, high potassium diet, regular exercise and optimal weight maintenance helps improve blood pressure. Please consult our doctor for further medical advice."
